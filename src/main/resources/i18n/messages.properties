home.searchGenes=To search the database of DEGs when under stress enter a gene name below. Alternativly an Ensembl stable id can be entered.
home.searchSNP=If you have a SNP id but don't know what gene it corresponds to you can enter it into the search box below. If the SNP is present on a specifix gene the database will be searched for that particular gene. eg: rs6998012, rs3795974
home.tabtitle = Idatabase
home.welcome = Welcome to the iDatabase search tool. This tool has two \
main functions.
summary.tabtitle=Dataset summary
home.apptitle=iDatabase
home.subtitle=Immunolical data made accessible
results.tabtitle=Results
results.tryAgain=Search for another gene.
results.explanation=\ was expressed differentially when subjected to the following \
stress factors.
home.noSuchGene=This Gene is not present in the database, please try again.
home.toSummary=Summary of the entire dataset
summary.about=This is the iDatabase search tool, it can be used to easily\
search through very large amounts of data. \
\
There are two main components to this tool:\
The stress factor search can be used to search through a\
database containing genes that are differentially expressed\
when subjected to stress factors.
snpPage.toMuchData=This selection resulted in too many SNPs to display in a heatmap,\
 showing the first 200.
home.DEGsearch=You can search for DEGs when submitted to stress factors using the Immune DEG tab. 
home.SNPsearch=The second main function is SNP search. Here you can either enter a SNP or Gene you're interested in to see whether those SNPs are significant in certain QTLs.
home.snpSearch.explain=To search for SNPs you can either enter a SNP id or gene name\
 into the searchbox below. If you're searching for a gene all\
 known SNPs on that gene are retrieved from the Ensembl database.\
 If you want to search for SNPs up- and downstream of the gene\
 you can enter the number of nucleotides in the 'region box' \
 that appears after clicking add region.
snpPage.noData=No data was found for the gene/SNP you searched for, please \
try again
snpPage.noHeatmapData=No data available to generate a heatmap of selected QTL.
